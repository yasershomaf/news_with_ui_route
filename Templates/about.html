<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  Windows PowerShell Help describes Windows PowerShell cmdlets, functions, scripts, and modules, and explains concepts, including the elements of the Windows PowerShell language.<br />
  Windows PowerShell does not include help files, but you can read the help topics online, or use the Update-Help cmdlet to download help files to your computer and then use the Get-Help cmdlet to display the help topics at the command line.<br />
  You can also use the Update-Help cmdlet to download updated help files as they are released so that your local help content is never obsolete.<br />
  Without help files, Get-Help displays auto-generated help for cmdlets,functions, and scripts.
